                In response to growing storage capacity concerns, we initiated a SharePoint Storage Optimization Project to proactively manage and sustain our environment. Our analysis revealed that we are currently using 14.4 TB of storage, with approximately 43% of SharePoint sites flagged for cleanup. The project’s goal was to reduce unnecessary storage usage, enhance performance, and avoid potential cost escalation.

                    I would like to share a summary of the work completed as part of the SharePoint Storage Optimization Project, along with key findings and challenges encountered during the process. This has been a time-intensive and data-sensitive project, requiring significant effort and attention to detail. Below are the key highlights and observations.

                        <strong>Storage Usage Analysis Across SharePoint</strong>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-1">Collected and analysed detailed storage data across all SharePoint sites to identify high-usage areas, versioning impact, and overall consumption trends. This helped in understanding where optimization efforts would have the most impact. <a href="#" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Click Here to view the SharePoint Site details.</a></p>

                        <ul class="space-y-2 text-slate-400 mt-2">
                            <li>By default, Microsoft allocates 25 TB of storage space when a new site is created. To address this, we modified the storage allocation method from automatic to manual. However, a key challenge was determining how to set manual storage limits for all sites efficiently and uniformly.</li>
                            <li>Implemented a default storage limit of 2 TB for all SharePoint sites to prevent unchecked growth and promote better space management.</li>
                            <li>PowerShell script was developed and executed to manually apply the storage limits to all existing SharePoint sites.</li>
                            <li>Storage alert notifications were enabled to automatically notify site owners when their site reaches 90% of the allocated limit, ensuring proactive management and timely action before the threshold is exceeded.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="text-slate-400 mt-2">

                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-1">Compiled a list of sites that are no longer in use and currently consuming 0 MB of space. A plan was initiated to reach out to the site owners for confirmation, with the intent to decommission and delete these sites to recover unused resources. A SharePoint Site Life Cycle Management policy is being planned. According to this policy, inactive sites that have not been used for more than six months will be automatically moved to the archive.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Testing the Impact of Retention Policy</strong>
                        <ul class="space-y-2 text-slate-400 mt-2">
                            <li>Conducted a test by excluding a SharePoint test site from the 7-year retention policy.</li>
                            <li>Observed that once the site was excluded, the Preservation Hold Library (PHL) was automatically deleted, freeing up significant storage space.</li>
                            <li>This confirmed that the retention policy is directly responsible for retaining deleted and versioned data, even if versioning is disabled in the site settings.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, while analysing user activity, it was discovered that many users’ OneDrive accounts also contain large amounts of data under PHL, contributing to storage bloat.</li>
                            <li>Although clearing this data could significantly optimize storage, doing so is not permitted due to the organization's strict data retention compliance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Versioning Configuration Optimized</strong>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-1">Initially, SharePoint sites were configured with the version history setting set to 'Automatic', which by default retained up to 500 versions of a document. To control storage usage, we switched from automatic to manual versioning and set the limit to 100 versions through the SharePoint UI. However, the UI restricts setting the limit below 100. To address this, a custom PowerShell script was developed that allows the version history limit to be set below 100 for any site. Based on InfoSec team guidance, the version history was standardized to retain a maximum of 15 versions. This setting was applied wherever applicable. However, due to the active retention policy with legal hold, we were unable to enforce this change in all environments. Documents under retention cannot have their version history or related metadata purged, limiting the full effectiveness of this adjustment. Despite this, the scripting mechanism is in place and ready for implementation wherever policy allows.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-1">Previously, there was no alerting mechanism in place for monitoring SharePoint tenant-level storage usage. As a result, when the storage approached its maximum limit, IT administrators were not notified in time, potentially leading to service disruptions. To address this, an automated alerting system has been implemented using n8n, an open-source workflow automation tool.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-1">This n8n is locally Hosted in File Server in Server Room, and Daily Automation is scheduled, All the Logs are saved in IT SharePoint.</p>
